This repository contains the research paper Anti-Money Laundering Using Graph Attention Network, which explores the application of Graph Attention Networks (GATs) in detecting suspicious financial transactions. The study highlights how graph-based deep learning models improve fraud detection by capturing complex transaction patterns, reducing false positives, and enhancing the scalability of anti-money laundering (AML) systems.

ðŸ“Œ Key Highlights

Problem Addressed: Money laundering is a major financial crime, impacting global economies and regulatory systems. Traditional AML detection systems struggle with scalability, interpretability, and accuracy in analyzing dynamic financial transactions.

Proposed Solution: A GAT-based AML framework leveraging temporal and spatial transaction data to enhance detection efficiency.

ðŸ“– Research Contribution

This study provides a scalable and efficient graph-based AML detection system that helps financial institutions and regulators identify and prevent fraudulent activities. The proposed model improves the interpretability and scalability of existing AML frameworks, contributing to global financial security.
